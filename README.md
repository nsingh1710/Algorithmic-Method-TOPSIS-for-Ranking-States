# Algorithmic-Method-TOPSIS-for-Ranking-States

 In this study an algorithmic method is composed using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) analysis which ranks the individual states by variability in cancer incidence and death rates across different populations which will help us focus on certain populations for cancer control programs. The data was pulled from the CDC website which provides state-specific and regional data for newly cancer incidence diagnosed cases and cancer death from 1999-2015. The strategy used for this analysis was to extend the TOPSIS method for decision-making problems with data by creating an algorithm to rank the states by age-adjusted incidence and mortality rate.
 
 
 
 The first 5 states listed for ranking of Incidence Rate known as best states are Arizona, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming. The first 5 states listed for ranking of Mortality Rate are Utah, Connecticut, Hawaii, Colorado, and Arizona. These five states are better in regards to the age-adjusted rate of new cases of cancer and rates of death from cancer. The worst states for Incidence Rate are Louisiana, Vermont, Washington, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Kentucky. The worst states for Mortality Rate are Delaware, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
